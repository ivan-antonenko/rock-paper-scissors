### Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

Created with HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JS.

**Live version** of the game is [here](https://ivan-antonenko.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

### Version 1 | Game in console

- the basic game logic was created;
- the user's choice input implemented using the recursive function with validation of the inserted in prompt value;
- the script for the console version is named [index--old.js](https://github.com/ivan-antonenko/rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/js/index--old.js)

### Version 2 | Game with UI

- SCSS preprocessor was chosen to conveniently organize styles;
- all icons are in the .svg format to ensure the high quality of the displayable content;
- a responsive layout is created so the game is playable on any device with a screen width starting from 320 px;
- the game restart happens without a page refresh.
